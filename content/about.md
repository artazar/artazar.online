Hey fellas! ü•Åü•Åü•Å

Welcome to my personal space, where I am going to post my engineer findings that do not fit into larger portals like Medium / dev.to / Hackernoon / Habr.

I have been building DevOps processes and tooling since 2019 and don't have plans to stop.

I have a deep passion in Kubernetes and the whole Cloud Native community.

Very brief description of projects I was a part of:

1) [In progress] Innovative music streaming app with crypto/metaverse/social patterns.
2) A medical lab performing molecular diagnostics of synthetic oligonucleotides.
3) Sports betting platform that handles near-real-time odds updates from live events.
4) Russian School of Mathematics (based in the US) with offline and virtual classroom activities.

My most valued certifications:
